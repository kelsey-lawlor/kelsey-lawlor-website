        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I’m a digital strategist and web operations specialist with over seven years of
          experience supporting healthcare and public health organizations. My work
          focuses on translating complex health data and regulatory requirements into
          accurate, accessible and user‑friendly digital products. I enjoy bringing
          together cross‑functional teams to deliver polished solutions that
          improve access to information and empower people to make informed
          decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career I’ve partnered closely with clinicians, policy
          leaders, developers and communicators to build data‑driven products, lead
          quality assurance processes, and optimize content for search. I’m
          dedicated to creating digital experiences that are compliant with
          accessibility standards, grounded in human‑centered design, and backed by
          robust analytics.
        </p>
